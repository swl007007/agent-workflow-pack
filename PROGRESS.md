# Production Integration Progress

- Approved plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-14-production-composition-release-fix.md`
- Branch: `fix/rc2-production-composition`
- Worktree: `/mnt/c/Users/swl00/IFPRI Dropbox/Weilun Shi/Plan/.worktrees/agent-workflow-pack-rc2`
- Release status: blocked; no RC4 or final tag is authorized.

## Completed

- Packaged production bundle prerequisites: commit `27c3ba9`.
- Atomic first-init Manifest/workspace/replay transaction: commit `1b4193b`.
- Packaged Trellis layout/discovery schemas and real scanner binding: commit `ed3dd3a`.
- Complete release authority preserved across Core Resolver: commit `85f5cb1`.
- Real packaged-bundle init composition and safe first overlay insertion: commit `c94fdda` plus the current production-init increment.
- Focused first-init/recovery verification: 29 tests passed; Ruff and `git diff --check` passed.
- Component-only release gates require absent production-integration evidence and therefore remain closed.

## In Progress

- Extend the completed production init path with managed launcher/runtime-control/workflow-lock artifacts, then implement strict no-op sync.

## Remaining

- Protected launcher internal channel.
- All 17 production owner bindings backed by reachable domain implementations.
- Installed-wheel black-box acceptance and strict second-sync no-op.
- Full Ruff, mypy, pytest, wheel/sdist, and production-integration evidence verification.
- Publication is intentionally deferred until every item above passes.

## Resume

Add RED assertions for `.agent-workflow/bin/agent-stack`, `runtime-control.json`, and the project workflow lock. Render them from `launcher_contract_from_release()` and packaged bytes, include them in ownership/Manifest authority, then use those committed contracts to implement production sync and strict second-sync no-op.
